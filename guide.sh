# A shell script needs to be saved with the extension .sh.
# The file needs to begin with the shebang line (#\!) to let the Linux system
# know which interpreter to use for the shell script.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For environments that support bash, use:
#!/bin/bash

# For environments that support shell, use:
#!/bin/sh

# Finally, you can run the script with the following command:
bash basic_script.sh

# You can also run a script without specifying bash:
./basic_script.sh

# Running the file this way might require the user to give permission first.
# Running it with bash doesnâ€™t require this permission.
chmod +x basic_script.sh

# Scripts can include user-defined variables. In fact, as scripts get larger in
# size, it is essential to have variables that are clearly defined and that have
# self-descriptive names.

# Shell scripts can be made interactive with the ability to accept input from
